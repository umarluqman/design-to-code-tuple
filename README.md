# Design to code series

### From Sketch file to Next.JS static HTML

This is inspired by Steve Schoger [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/RC9cYdbQ-_c) where he shared how he refactored this website. https://tuple.app

Stacks:

- Next.JS
- Chakra-UI

The design is based on his [Sketch file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tictbuvpnzxpf7v/tuple-after.sketch?dl=0)

And I uploaded it to a shareable Adobe XD link so everyone can see, [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d5a08ff6-9c2e-45a2-4108-63525216d89a-a391/)
